# Contributing to XOSP

We love contributions from the community so if you want to submit patches you can do it by pushing on our gerrit: review.xosp.org:8081

- First make sure that your Name and Email are named globally on Git: 

      $ git config --global user.name "YourName"
      $ git config --global user.email "YourEmail"

- Create a SSH Key and add it to your Gerrit Profile, otherwise you will not be able to push your changes, to do so just follow the steps foundable here: https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/
- Now, select the repo/s you're interested to contribute to from here: http://review.xosp.org:8081/#/admin/projects/
- Clone it with the SSH method like here for example:

      $ git clone ssh://your_username@review.xosp.org:29418/your_repo

- Make your changes and commit as usual,when pusing do like this:

      $ git push origin HEAD:refs/for/xosp-n-rebase

- Perfect! you now uploaded your very first patch on Gerrit. Please allow time for it to be verified, depending by the change it could take from very less to very much time

- If you want to assign a topic to your commit just push the commit as follow:

      $ git clone ssh://your_username@review.xosp.org:29418/your_repo -o topic=your_topic

- If you made mistakes or new changes were made to the current commit just use amend:

      $ git add -A
      $ git commit -s --amend --no-edit

If you're on Linux you can use directly the command git-review to push instead of git push which is much more automated
